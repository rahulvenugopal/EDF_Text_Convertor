# EDF_Text_Convertor
- Convert EDF file to text file
- Specific to EDF files generated from Polyman software containing sleep stages
- Once we have text files, use python to get another text file with just labels for stages
- One can modify the string names as needed

## Tutorial
- Run the .m file
- Select the folder with readEDF and Sleep stage creator functions
- Prompt will ask you to navigate and select all the .edf scored files
- It would be a good idea to put all scored files in a single folder before you run the script
- Multi-select is enabled and once you select, script will start converting all .edf files
- Look at the logs updated in MATLAB console window (if any issues)

- Run the .py script
- Select the directory with text files
